        <img src="1200px-Star_of_David.svg.png" alt="Star of David" style="width:300px;height:350px;float:right;"><h2>Jews: </h2><p>The Nazis impacted the Jews majorly. The Nazis were highly racist towards them and treated them worse than animals. They encouraged anti-semitism and accepted that Jews were a deadly extraterrestrial race seeking to demolish other races, which was absolute nonsense. They considered the Jews an inferior race, burdening them and thought of themselves as the only superior race. So the Nazis aimed to remove them entirely from the face of the earth. Hitler had antisemitic laws passed which stripped them from their human rights and treated them worse than animals. The Nazi’s made life harder and harder for them; soon, the Holocaust took place. The Nazi’s sent the Jews to concentration camps where they were imprisoned and killed. The Nazi’s committed Genocide on a large scale; they killed around 6 million Jews out of cold blood. They wiped out two-thirds of the European Jewish population. Those who survived would have to live with nightmares of the suffering in the concentration camps and seeing their family and friends murdered in plain sight.</p></div>
    <div><img src="lolgermanwom.jpg" alt="Women" style="width:200px;height:275px;float:right;"><h2>Woman: </h2><p>Hitler encouraged the ‘traditional family, where women were at home looking after the family and men worked and produced money. Hitler also forced the women to have children; if they had many children, they received the ‘Mother's Cross’  as a reward. There were two main reasons why Hitler wanted them to have many children. One reason was so that the Aryan population could grow larger and preserve their race; the other was so the children could grow up, join the army and fight in the war. The Nazis expected women to have a particular appearance. They had to be physically fit, have an Aryan appearance, wear plain clothes, flat shoes and have hair buns. Wearing makeup and dye was prohibited, and they weren’t allowed to smoke in public.</p></div>
    <div><img src="youth.jpg" alt="Youth" style="width:200px;height:275px;float:right;"><h2>Youth: </h2><p>The Nazi’s controlled the children because they wanted them to preserve the future of the Aryan Race. Hitler quoted, “Whoever has the youth has the future.” The Nazis forced children from 10 - 18 years old to go to the Hitler Youth Camps. The Nazis taught the youth their ideas like anti-semitism, gender expectations, Hitler was the best, and how to fight (boys) or be mothers (girls). The majority of Aryan children in Germany were members of the youth camp; non-Aryans/Jews were not allowed to join. In 1926 Hitler Youth was founded and had only a few thousand members, then when the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hitler banned all other scout groups, and members of the group rose to half a million. By 1940, there were 8 million members in Hitler Youth.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Disabled: </h2><p>The Nazis believed that the disabled were inferior and viewed them as a burden on German society. The Nazis wanted to destroy all other races who weren’t Aryan. Hitler made a law so that the Nazis could sterilise the disabled so they couldn’t produce children. Four hundred thousand disabled people weren’t able to have children once Hitler passed the law. Later Hitler sent the disabled to the ‘euthanasia centres’ where the Nazis killed 70,273 disabled people.</p></div>
