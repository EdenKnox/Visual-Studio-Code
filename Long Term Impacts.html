      <p>By the end of WW2, many Nazis were involved in the genocide of 6 million Jews and other people. Some of those Nazis managed to escape their judgement by moving to another country with a fake name and ID. Popular destinations the Nazis escaped to included countries like Argentina, Australia, Norway etc. They were hunted down by people called The Nazi Hunters who dedicated their life to search for the Nazis so they could face justice. Many of the Nazi Hunters had their family and friends tortured and killed by the Nazis and they swore the Nazis will not get away with it. A famous Nazi Hunter named Simon Wiesenthal barely survived the holocaust while 89 of his family members were murdered, he made it his life quest to find the Nazis responsible for the deaths. Simon Wiesenthal quoted “When history looks back I want people to know the Nazis weren't able to kill millions of people and get away with it”. For decades the Nazi Hunters pursued the Nazis and bought them to trial, many of the higher ranking Nazis were bought to trial at the famous Nuremberg trials. </p></div>
