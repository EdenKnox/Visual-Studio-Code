                 <ul>
                     <li><p><b>Never post your personal information online -</b> This can include your phone number, email address, password, school name, etc. This information could be used against you which could result in cyberbullying.
                    </p></li>
                     <li><p><b>Ignore messages from unfamiliar people -</b> if you get a message from someone you don’t know, do not open it and delete it immediately. The message could be a form of cyberbullying or sometimes even a virus. It is best to delete the message if you are unsure.
                    </p></li>
                     <li><p><b>Proofreading -</b> Make sure to proofread your messages before sending them. People could interpret things differently; make your messages easy to read and understand. If a person does take it the wrong way, apologise and explain later to avoid cyberbullying.
