            <p>Cyberbullying can have 4 major effects on a person. Emotional, Mental, Physical and Behavioural. Emotional effects could result in Humiliation, Isolation, Anger, etc. This can change a person’s emotional state and give them low self-confidence. Mental effects can give a person depression, social anxiety and low self-esteem. These changes can also result in low self-confidence which can create stress and loneliness. Physical effects from cyberbullying can affect sleep and eating habits. This would be unhealthy for the body which can result in not getting enough sleep and starvation. Lastly, Behavioural effects could be skipping school, using drugs or even carrying a weapon. This is because the person would be scared of their personal space so they will become more cautious of their surroundings. Cyberbullying overall can have negative effects on a person which in the worst-case scenario,  can lead to suicide.
